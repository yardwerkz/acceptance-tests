**Overview**

This repository contains the acceptance tests for YardWerKz, an application for a two-sided marketplace that brings customers of lawn care services together with werkers that do lawn care.

We are focused on the application, so we will assume that the customer or werker will be interacting with the application to access the marketplace.

The acceptance tests reflect what we know at the time of development. This is a living repository.
